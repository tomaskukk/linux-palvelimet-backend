Website to return linux-course exercises

## Why make a website for this?

In our linux-servers course we have to return exercises in a website. Rather than just doing it with wordpress or github.io
I decided to try and make my own blog-website. I'm trying to accomplish for user to save blog posts in the website easily. These
posts can be then seen by everyone but only the owner can edit and add content to these posts.

## What is done?

I have basic crud working with user authentication. Posts can be modified and add more sections to already existing post.

## What is coming?

For the posts to be solid and readable, I want to be able to save images within the posts. Also the sources section isn't working yet.
Later this website could work as my home website rather than just exercise-returing website.
